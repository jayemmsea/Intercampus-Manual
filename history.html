<h1>History</h1>
<h2>Pratt Brooklyn Campus</h2>        
    <a title="Jim.henderson, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Prattdekalbjeh.JPG"><img width="512" alt="Prattdekalbjeh" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Prattdekalbjeh.JPG/512px-Prattdekalbjeh.JPG?20080516161241"></a>
    <p>Pratt Institute was founded in 1887 by Charles Pratt, who had the goal of providing an affordable and accessible college education to students of all backgrounds. The original location in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn still serves as the main campus for Pratt’s undergraduate population and graduate population (minus students from the School of Information) and spans 25 acres. The Pratt Institute Sculpture Park, founded in 1999, is the largest contemporary sculpture park in New York City, and is open to the public during the daytime. <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/about/history/">(Source 1)</a>  <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/about/visit-pratt/sculpture-park/">(Source 2)</a></p>

    <p>Pratt Manhattan Center, located at 144 West 14th Street, is home to the School of Information and various graduate and associate programs, including the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. The Pratt Library and Information Science (LIS) program is the oldest of its kind in North America, dating back to 1890, when Pratt began offering courses in cataloging and library economics. In the 1990s, Pratt began to hold LIS classes in various buildings in Manhattan in order to cater to working professionals that could take classes in the evening. This was a successful idea, and in 2022, the Pratt  School of Information found a permanent home in Manhattan at 144 West 14th Street. <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/information/about-the-school-of-information/history/">(Source)</a></p>
<h2>Pratt Utica Campus</h2>
    <p>Less known is Pratt Institute’s satellite campus upstate in Utica, NY. Pratt’s presence in Utica is the result of a 1999 collaboration with Munson, a fine arts center. Through the Pratt at Munson-Williams-Proctor (or PrattMWP) program, students can spend their first two years at Pratt Munson and then transfer to the main campus in Brooklyn for the final two years of their undergraduate degree. <a href="https://www.prattmunson.edu/who-we-are/ ">(Source)</a></p>
