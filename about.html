            <p> Jack McKernan is a historian and aspiring archivist currently participating in the MSLIS program at Pratt Institute School of Information. He is a graduate of Fordham University with an MA in Modern History. His areas of interest were in urban social movements, covering the Irish Lesbian Gay movement in New York and the later developments in the revolutionary New Left in the context of the heroin crisis of the late 60s and early 70s. His current research focuses on the genesis and maintenance of independent and/or radical archives. He is from Long Island and regrets being obstinately proud of that fact. Jack had a lot of fun getting the JavaScript on this page to work right and looks forward to solving new and more complicated technical problems down the road on his way to becoming an archivist.
