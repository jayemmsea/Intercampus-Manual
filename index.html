        <p>Pratt: An Intercampus Manual is a guide for students at Pratt Institute that want to make the most out of the resources during their time at school. Pratt Institute consists of two main campuses in Brooklyn and Manhattan and a satellite location in Utica.</p>        
        <p>Because every program is based in a single location, students will spend a majority of their time at Pratt at either the Brooklyn or Manhattan campus. The physical distance and time it takes to travel between the two locations makes students think it is easier to only visit one of the campuses. In doing so, they are missing out on valuable resources that can enhance their academic experience. We hope that the information provided on this website will serve to both educate students on the rich history of these campuses and equip them with the knowledge needed to make the most out of their time at Pratt Institute.</p>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>Across its three campuses, Pratt is home to a wide variety of academic and professional resources that students can take advantage of to achieve success in their desired career fields.</p>
